                League of Legends is one of the most difficult games to get into as a new player. At the time of this post
                League currently has 170 champions each with an average of four usable abilities and one passive ability. Doing
                the math it comes out to ~850 different things a player has to understand to even feel comfortable playing the game.
                This doesn't include the plethora of items the player has access to either. All together a new player has a mountain
                of things they have to understand to start enjoying one of the most popular games of all time. I believe there are
                a few things Riot could do to help shorten that learning time and retain more players.

                When a new player logs into League of Legends for the first time they are met with three tutorial levels aimed
                at giving a brief introduction to what League of Legends is all about.
