                Arkham Knight Intro Design Analysis

                The intro of a video game. Half an hour of precisely tuned gameplay to teach players
                how and why they should keep playing. What the developers choose to include in these
                few minutes must be carefully crafted as to avoid players losing interest or becoming
                too frustrated to continue playing, so it's easy to say that intros are important.
                It is this reason that I would like to analyze the intro of Batman Arkham Knight to
                see where it gets things correct and what could have been changed to help better prepare
                new players on becoming the "Batman".

                What purpose does the intro to a video game serve?

            <div className={'flex justify-start px-10 md:px-100 font-outfit'}>
                An intro to any good video game should be able to get the player
                immersed in the world, familiar with a few characters, and most importantly
                teach the player the basic controls they will need know, all without having
                to spell it out for them. It's no easy task, but when done correctly the player
                no longer feels like they are playing a video game. They feel like they are apart
                of the world, that they are the main character, and that their actions really have
                an impact.
