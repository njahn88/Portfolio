                The intro of a video game. Half an hour of precisely tuned gameplay to teach players
                how and why they should keep playing. What the developers choose to include in these
                few minutes must be carefully crafted as to avoid players losing interest or becoming
                too frustrated to continue playing, so it's easy to say that intros are important.
