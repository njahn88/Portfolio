                Building on the backs of the games that came before it, the Rocksteady combat designers had to ensure the
                "heart" of the game was still in tact while also adding some new mechanics along the way. What resulted was
                a heavily polished system that consistently pushed the player to learn and adapt to the enemies actions. This is
                why I would like to look into what changes the developers made and the techniques they used to create a combat
                system that anyone could succeed with while also leaving room for skill expression.
